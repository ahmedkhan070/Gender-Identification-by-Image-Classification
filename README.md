### Gender Classification using VGG16 and Transfer Learning

**Project Overview**

This project aims to develop a robust gender classification model using the VGG16 architecture and transfer learning. The model will be trained on a dataset containing images of male and female subjects, which is already split into training, validation, and testing sets.

**Dataset**

The dataset consists of images categorized into 'Male' and 'Female' subdirectories within the 'Train', 'Validation', and 'Test' folders.

**Approach**

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Images are preprocessed using ImageDataGenerator for normalization and augmentation.
2. **Model Architecture:** A VGG16 model is loaded with pre-trained weights and its top layers are fine-tuned for gender classification.
3. **Training:** The model is trained on the training dataset using data generators for efficient batching.
4. **Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated on the validation set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Visualization:** Visualizations will be generated to analyze model performance and identify potential issues.

**Dependencies**

* TensorFlow
* Keras
* OpenCV (for potential image processing)

**Future Work**

* Explore different data augmentation techniques.
* Experiment with other pre-trained models.
* Improve model performance through hyperparameter tuning.

**Note:** This README will be updated as the project progresses.

**Additional Information**

* Detailed code explanations and comments will be included in the code.
* Specific hyperparameters and training configurations will be documented.
